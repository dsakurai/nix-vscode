Jupyter Demo
============

Use VSCode and its Dev Container feature to run this project. It will automatically set up the virtual environment that can be picked up by VSCode Python and Jupyter extensions.

If the execution of the notebook fails, this often means that the shared libraries were not picked up by the virtual environment.
Necessary flags are found in the file named `.env`, which is autogenerated when the Dev Container is first executed (through its postCreation hook).
Make sure that this file is generated. You can also manually generate it:
```
$ ./nix-scripts/nix-develop
```

Finally, refresh the environment variables in the virtual environment loaded by Python / Jupyter extensions.
Sometimes, this is not necessary. Sometimes, you just have to open a Jupyter notebook and select the proper venv.
In any case, you can reload the VSCode window intead: open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Reload Window".

Security
--------

This system cannot be used by multiple users if security is a concern. This is because that the Jupyter server is set up in such a way that it will be automatically logged in as the default podman user. In other words, there is no proper user management on Jupyter's side.
